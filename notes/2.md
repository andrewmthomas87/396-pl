## Precise language definition

Syntax
- Algol: BNF
- Lisp: s-expr

Semantics
- Algol: informal english, independent of machine
- Lisp: meta-circular interpreter

1. Define an abstract syntax: description as trees
  - Indirect: functions that take apart tree & ask questions (accessors & predicates)
2. No commitment to concrete syntax
  - Not really a language problem, only care about structure of programs
3. Specify the state of the evaluation
  - E.g., eval in LISP takes s-expr & list of pairs (environment)
4. Evaluator

### Micro Algol

#### Abstract syntax

- variable
  - isvar(c)
- constant
  - iscons(c)
  - val(c)
- sum
  - issum(c)
  - sum-left(c)
  - sum-right(c)
- etc.
- program
  - last(p): size of program
  - ith(p): access ith statement

#### Evaluator

program p

environment E: map
  - lookup
  - update

eval: p x E -> E
  - returns final state of program

ALGOL -> abstract syntax -> partial recursive function
ALGOL -> lambda-notation, applicative structures -> abstract machines
- not lambda calculus itself
- increase abstraction
- more precise

### What is the fundamental notation for programs?

Needs to unify & express a series of features necessary for writing very expressive programs
1. Arithmetic expressions
2. Arrays & array indexing (linear algebra)
3. Data structures, aggregate data
4. Procedures
  - because structured programming becoming mainstream
  - nested
  - recursive
5. Conditionals

Applicative expressions (AE)
- Abstract set of identifiers: id
  - enumerable set
  - some have special meaning
- Some way to represent functions: lambda (id ...) AE
- Application: (AE ...)

- Look a lot like s-expr
- Implicit def of predicates & accessors

### Abstract machine

SECD machine

Automata: sequence of states, transfer function
State contains S, E, C, D

A state consists of:
- S is stack
  - Recent results that have been computed
  - ListOf(AE)
- E is environment
  - AE list w/ pairs of identifiers & values
  - ListOf(PairOf(AE))
- C is control/command
  - AE currently evaluating
  - ListOf(AE)
- D is dump
  - Stash away information that is not currently being used for evaluation (state itself)
  - State
Recursive definition (represented as tree)

1. (S, E, nil, (S', E', C', D')) -> ((h S) * S', E', C', D')
  - (h S) is head of the stack, i.e. the result of the last execution
2. (S, E, C, D): condition on type of C
  a. if (h C) is an id
    - -> (lookup(E, (h C)) :: S, E, (t C), D)
  b. if (h C) is a lambda (x ...) e
    - -> ((closure (x ...) E e) :: S, E, (t C), D)
  c. if (h C) is (C1, ..., Cn)
    - -> (S, E, (C1, ..., Cn, ap), D)
    - special symbol indicating this is an application
  d. if (h C) is ap
    - empty stack: S1, S2, ... = lambda (...) e
    - substitute stack entries into function body
    - -> (nil, E, e subst S2 ..., D)
