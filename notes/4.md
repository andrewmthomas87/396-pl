Lambda calculus consists of
- identifiers
- (lambda x M)
- (M M)

- What can we express?
  - Defineability of partial recursive functions
- What can we prove?
  - Consistency: can't prove something & it's negation

Church numerals
- 0: l f l x x
- 1: l f l x f x
- 2: l f l x f (f x)
- n: l f l x f^n x

Should be able to define successor: n -> n + 1
l n l f l x f (n f x)

beta & eta laws help us simplify expressions
symmetry: go from more complex to less complex & reverse as well
compatible: can replace in any context, local changes, retain equality
together, these define notion of equality
transitive, symmetric, compatible closure

Instead of proving true neq false, prove more general: if M = N, then there exists L such that starting w/ M, repeatedly applying in the forward direction, you can get to L', M -> L' & N -> L'
Can't simplify true or false further w/ beta & eta, so easy to say M neq N
Normal forms: can't be simplified further, not all terms have a normal form (like omega)
If M & N in normal form, they have to be the same syntactically modulo their bound variables (which don't matter)

Formation of diamond: if L -> M & L -> N, there exists L' such that you can M -> L' & N -> L'

  -> M
L      -> L'
  -> N

Radix: opportunity to apply rule

Lambda calculus doesn't prescribe a strategy for reducing, which doesn't make sense for PL
Standard reduction: an extension/re-visiting of lambda calculus so that we can prescribe a strategy for reducing to the normal form

Standard reduction fails to relate to PL well, call by value doesn't work, call by name isn't even quite valid
Decade of despair

Adds delta axiom (family of axioms): replace calls to certain operators w/ their result
