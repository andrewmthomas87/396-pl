lambda-based models of PL
- (simple) types: well-typed programs do not error (terminate, give simplest term)
- recursion (y): Kleene theorem of recursion

Kleene defines rules that allow us to construct mathematical object that describes f
- Given f(x...) = E\[f,x...\]
1. Simplify AE if all pieces are numbers
2. Simplify conditionals when test is an equality where all pieces are numbers
3. Replace all appearances of parameters w/ numbers
4. f(a,...)=b, then we can replace E1 where f(a,...) with E\[b/f(a,...)\]

f(m,n) = if m=n then m+1 else f(m,f(m-1,n+1))

1. f(1,1) =(R3) if 1=1 then 1+1 else f(1,f(1-1,1+1))
2. f(1,1) =(R1) if 1=1 then 2 else f(1,f(0,2))
3. f(1,1) =(R2) 2
4. f(2,0) =(R3) if 2=0 then 2+1 else f(2,f(2-1,0+1))
5. f(2,0) =(R2) f(2,f(2-1,0+1))
6. f(2,0) =(R1) f(2,f(1,1))
7. f(2,0) =(R4) f(2,2)

f = {((a,b),c) | f(a,b)=c can be derived w/ R1-R4}

function definition is a set of constraints on the function that contains all pairs

Any equation of the form f(x,...) = E\[f,x...\] has a function g s.t.
1. Computed w/ R1-R4
2. g is less defined than g' where g' is a solution to the equation (it is the worst)
