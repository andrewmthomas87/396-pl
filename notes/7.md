# 2/14: Forklift-Certified Types

- "Linear types can change the world!" [Wadler '90]
- "Imple of the typed call-by-value lambda-calclus, using a stack of regions" [Tofte & Talpon '94]
- "Alias Types for Recursive Data Structures" [Walker & Marrisett '00]

- Linear types
- Allocation
  - Stack: C, explicit pairs of alloc->dealloc, static lifetimes
  - Heap: Java, garbage collection, unknown lifetimes
  - Known size required to move from heap to stack
- Explicit regions
  - Stack of regions
  - Translation of typed call-by-value lambda-calculus to use stack of regions
  - Difficulties in knowing when to free
- Linear types
  - invariant: one access path, once accessed, memory is free
  - cost: one access path, restriction on data structures
  - goal: maintain memory management but w/ references
- Recursive O.S.
  - Location Polymorphism
  - Encapsulation
    - Existential types
  - Type defn for linked list, binary tree
